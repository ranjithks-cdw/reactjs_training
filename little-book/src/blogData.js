    title: "How to Time Travel",
    details:
      "There is an old saying that life is a journey. In fact, life is many journeys. The more of them you take, the longer it will seem. I thought about this. Then I thought about my childhood. It turns out that I rode the bus to school nearly 200 days a year for more than 10 years. That’s 2,000 days. I don’t remember most of those days. They blur together. But when I was a child, once a year, we would take a family vacation. I remember every single one of these. The first one was to St Louis. It was the first time I was on an airplane. My sister was maybe 2 or 3 years old. I remember her in her little stroller. Each year we took a trip. Dallas. Baltimore. Chicago. Seattle. When I look back on my life and the experiences I have had, I think back to these journeys. I remember every one of them. They are vivid life experiences that I shared with the people I care about. My life is longer because of the journeys I have taken. When I am on my death bed, I want to look back at my life, and have all these vivid memories. I want them to be full and different every single day.",

    title: "Summer - A Long Tale",
    details:
      "Most of us have, at some point, considered what we would do if we could travel back in time. Maybe we would give ourselves some hot investment advice and become millionaires, or change history for the better, or witness our favorite historical event. If I could travel back in time and do one thing, I wouldn’t cheat on the stock market, or kill Hitler. I would simply give myself a few words of advice. What follows are some of the most important lessons I’ve learned in life- from books, from hard-fought experience, from friends, teachers and mentors much wiser than myself. Some of these lessons took me a very long time to learn- and while I wish I could have learned them faster, it would have taken me even longer if I didn’t have help. Sadly, we can’t time travel, but what we can do is learn from others, which is a hell of a lot faster than trying to figure things out for ourselves. Here are 40 little knowledge bombs that, in my opinion, took me way too long to learn.",

    title: "I Don’t Really Love To Travel",
    details:
      "We landed on Saturday, and it’s been lovely. We’ve had a few crêpes, some fries and fruits, and more than our fair share of pain au chocolate, though for the most part it’s been bière de Bretagne, baguettes, brown-bagged blocks of cheese, and the best butter I’ve ever had in my life — Jean Yves Bordier lives up to his acclaim, and we indulged in his life’s work by shamelessly hacking little pats with the tiny metal coffee spoons in our hotel room, as this was all we had when the moment of need came upon us. We had oysters along the ocean, chucking the shells into piles on the beach as we watched the jade green tide pull itself in, and we walked hand in hand until darkness, which we were surprised to find out isn’t until nearly midnight this time of year. Again, as I said, it’s been lovely. And yet even as I’m here I’m also not here, because the whole thing feels sort of silly — sort of over-indulgent; an escape to nowhere, with nothing, where all of this exists for real for the people who are here, but exists only in experience for us, a sort of fantasy moment where we both are and yet are not, half of us taking from it what we want because the other half of us knows we don’t actually belong. This is not our real life. This is fabrication — perhaps not for those living here, but certainly for us.",

    title: "How To Binge Travel Like It’s Your Job",
    details:
      "People often ask me some version of How the hell do you do it? in reference to my travel-heavy, job-light existence these last few years. I freelance sporadically as a brand & marketing strategist, but am predominantly free to wander the globe doing some combination of yoga, photography, ukulele-playing, and formulating elaborate excuses to not finish my travel memoir. Now, I realize everyone’s financial situation and mosquito tolerance is different, but here is a strategic sampler platter of travel tips that make my lucky lifestyle possible, in case a few of these end up being useful to you. Unless you’re reading this from your Tesla jet ski on your private island, you probably need some form of income to finance extended travels. Personally I prefer working my tushie off for a few months when freelance projects arise, and then getting the hell out of dodge when work slows down or if I’m craving a break that a Kit-Kat won’t satisfy. Obviously this requires a somewhat flexible housing and employment situation, but that’s why Al Gore invented the internet and made things like airbnb and Slack possible.",

    title: "Why every travel photographer should carry a notebook",
    details:
      "Even before I took up my writing career again — to be able to both shoot and write for the articles I’m doing — I’ve been carrying a black, pocket-sized notebook. This journal is what I turn to when I sit down to start writing my articles. It is filled with words, sentences and letters, most of them written in a barely decryptable handwriting. I use it to write down the addresses and names of the restaurants and hotels I’m visiting. And the time schedules for trains or names of traditional meals, straight forward stuff. But all of those facts are available online, for you and everyone else. The most important words to jot down are the details you can’t Google. How it feels like to visit that particular restaurant, what the main course smelled like or how the waiter ended up with that scar on his upper lip. The goal is to collect something that not everyone (actually only the people that visited the exact same spot as you) knows.",

    title: "The Solo Traveler’s Guide",
    details:
      "Last December, I embarked on a month-long solo trip to Eastern Europe. I’d been feeling a bit stalled personally and professionally, and I thought a big adventure would help me get unstuck. I booked a flight to Estonia, reserved a few nights in an Airbnb, and planned to figure out the rest when I got there — after all, everything was up to me. It was a thrilling thought: I was exploring a foreign country entirely on my own, with no one else’s schedule, wants, or needs to consider. I wandered the charming cobbled streets of Tallinn, the capital city. I sipped hot sea buckthorn tea at a Christmas market and bought a pair of reindeer-patterned leg warmers to cope with the single-digit temperatures. But a day or two later, shivering under the weak afternoon sun and surrounded by groups snapping photos, it hit me: I was really, truly alone in a place where I knew no one. And even though I’d chosen to come there, I was lonely. Almost as soon as I recognized my own loneliness, I was disappointed by it. Feeling this way seemed at odds with the spirit of a solo adventure. What I didn’t know then — but have since come to learn — is that even if you genuinely enjoy traveling by yourself (and I do), you won’t necessarily love every single minute of it. In addition to that burst of quiet joy you feel watching a breathtaking sunset in solitude or the rush of pride you get from successfully navigating a new transit system, you’ll probably have a few moments when you’re tired of having no one but yourself for company. For most of us, a little loneliness is inevitable, but it doesn’t have to ruin your trip",

    title: "How Airbnb Won Customers by Offering a Free Night at the Louvre",
    details:
      "Little did he know what Airbnb had in mind. What would you do if you possessed all the cash in the world and could spend it in any way you like? Would you embark on a journey to a beautiful island? Would you buy a sea-facing apartment with a stunning view? Would you travel the world? Well, all of them are possible with the right amount of money. However, there is one irreplaceable experience — a night at the Musée du Louvre. A dream for most art aficionados was turned into reality thanks to Airbnb. Airbnb opened the doors to its customers to experience a night at this monumental masterpiece for… free. That’s right. Free. On April 30 of last year, Airbnb and the Louvre were hosting a lucky pair of guests for one unforgettable night among the masterpieces to celebrate the 30th birthday of the Louvre Pyramid. The itinerary was nothing short of amazing. Here’s what it looked like.",

      "Like many teachers, I’ve been confined to teaching from behind a screen following the pandemic. Luckily, technology has provided us with a brilliant way to keep virtual education interesting. Whether you’re a teacher preparing for the upcoming scholastic year, or a parent trying to find new ways of keeping your children entertained, virtual adventures are an innovative way of learning from home. Virtual tours have taken off exponentially since the pandemic hit. Libraries, national parks, museums, and heritage sites have all taken to the new technology to allow visitors in. Sure, it’s not the same as being there physically, but it sure beats looking at a brochure.",

      "If you’re like me, you haven’t done a lot of photography in the last few months. I’ve done a fair amount of product work in the studio, but that gets boring after a while. No matter where you live or your personal situation, your photography almost certainly isn’t what it was before this year. So, maybe it’s time to press Ctrl-Alt-Del and reboot the whole system. I’m still not getting out as much as I used to, and I’m certainly not doing any traveling.But I am taking the camera with me when I do get out, and I’ve started looking at places I can go and things to shoot where I can still be isolated enough to feel safe.",
